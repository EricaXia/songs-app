[Verse 1]
Just living on a Sunday morning
Got my toast and tea and I'm warm and
I just thought I'd think about
All the things to get and keep getting
Never enough, not enough and never ending
I just thought I'd think about
Just living on a Sunday morning
Got my toast and tea and I'm warm and
I just thought I'd think about
All the things to get and keep getting
Never enough, not enough and never ending
I just thought I'd think about

[Chorus]
And it might be
The comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky
But could never parallel the challenge of an acquisition in the
Here and now, here and now

[Verse 2]
Parody of yourself in color
Giving it to everybody but your mother
And you've got much to think about
Soaring higher with every treason
Never justify, never reason
You've got much to think about

[Chorus]
And it might be
The comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky
But could never parallel the challenge of an acquisition in the
Here and now, here and now
The comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky
But could never parallel the challenge of an acquisition in the
Here and now, here and now

[Chorus]
And it might be
Parody of yourself in color
Giving it to everybody but your mother
And you've got much to think about
Soaring higher with every treason
Never justify, never reason
You've got much to think about

[Chorus]
And it might be
The comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky
But could never parallel the challenge of an acquisition in the
Here and now, here and now
The comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky
But could never parallel the challenge of an acquisition in the
Here and now, here and now

[Chorus]
And it might be
The comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky
But could never parallel the challenge of an acquisition in the
Here and now, here and now
And it might, might
