[Verse 1: Monkey]
Roll up, hop out and blast
When man's pullin' up (Ugh)
I'm with the meanest of dargs
Dem boy dem scared of us
.40 bull dog, yeah, it barks
It'll definitely tear you up
Servin' T-T up in O
Just to get my cheddar up (Truss')
My mother pissed
When the pigs man just found lil wap
Some other time I'll get my shit
That she ain't heard of brah
Waps when we step
The jewellery's got it tucked (Tucked)
My nigga itchy with his fingers
So don't be playin' up
They lie on tracks (They lie on tracks)
We ride with waps (We ride with waps)
Risk my freedom
Six in the spin tryna turn man pack (Turn man pack)
Bad man like Siegel
Lifestyle be illegal (Be illegal)
The feds did a sweep last week
They locked like half of my people
Free Skeng, free Rose
That's backroad and pose
Hella kwengins, that's us
Man ain't gotta talk too much, they know (Know)
My strip come hot like lava (Lava)
Dem man can't come to the Gaza (Gaza)
Run man down, grab man
Ching man then I go teef in Ghana

[Verse 2: Soze]
G1 work with the fork
The fork got lost, where's that spoon?
If my young boy lose that food
Put one in the pot and we're scrapin' out two (Whip)
When G1 workin' the pot
We gather around, we're watchin' it lock
Bitch wanna kiss and hug
But I'm on the hunt for the straightest drop
Bitch wanna kiss and hug
I'm tryna get rich like Ace and Mitch (Like Ace and Mitch)
She want all my love
She must not know that Soze on a brick (Trap)
PCX slidin', don't slip
Slip, catch one in the wig
I ain't ever seen a bitch like this
She breakin' down packs and greasin' up sticks
Who wanna cross that line?
I'll take that step, I'll burn that bridge (Hmm)
Who want a rock right now?
I'm takin' in orders and breakin' it down (Trap)
My young boy wanna go O
When it's M way time he's playin' around
Ridin' around, linin' up plugs, takin' 'em down

[Verse 3: Rzo Munna]
I came a long way from bein' that worker (You know)
Opps talk funds and guns but trust me, they ain't ever seen no burner
I beg a man don't make man turn up, skrr up
Gut shot, leave man curl up
Do it on the *****
Either way, I got intent to murder
A man put a hand on my skin
You dumb? Have manners
The dumb little bitch was surprised when she heard I was lightskin
She thought I was Arab (Bitch)
I slap 0.1s for cunch and 0.15 for the ends, that's patterned
Free all the guys on the landing, punchin' and kickin' with cases, outstandin'
Them man there washed on the block
They make no guwop but they still out standin' (Bums)
You need to get your arse in the trap
Find a place on the map, hit the M and start bankin'
And everybody's out on a mad ting
'Til I shank him, man I leave man plankin'
2AM, I'm on my way again to hit a shot, I'm out here vampin'
Night shift, it gets lonely
Just cats, no homies (No)
Where's all the Carty's and Rolly's?
They get snatched like cats
I'm settin' up shop on my lonely
I got packs on maps
Kway away from home
But they come back, covert it to cash (Trap, trap, trap)
