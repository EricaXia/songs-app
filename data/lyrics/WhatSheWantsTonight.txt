[Verse 1]
She walks up, velvet rope unhooks
She snaps her fingers and a drink comes
She locks you down with just one look
She’s got this whole club undone

[Verse 2]
If she’s on the rebound, you ain’t gonna know it
Coming off a heartbreak, she ain’t gonna show it
She’s eyes caught, red dot, locked on me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she’s made of fire
Said, she ain’t going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry

[Chorus]
Don’t even know what she’ll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I’m hers in the blink of an eye
She don’t take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight

[Verse 3]
I get to catch all her secrets
Sequins bouncing off flashing lights
If she wants it then we’re leaving
Get me home, park the truck, cut the tires

[Verse 4]
I get to be where she goes when she’s lonely
The last door of the night she’s closing
Oh, I know she could have anything but

[Pre-Chorus]
She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she’s made of fire
Said she ain’t going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry

[Chorus]
Don’t even know what she’ll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I’m hers in the blink of an eye
She don’t take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight

[Bridge]
And I don’t know how I got to be the only thing she needs right now

[Pre-Chorus]
She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she’s made of fire
Said she ain’t going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry

[Chorus]
Don’t even know what she’ll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I’m hers in the blink of an eye
She don’t take no and i love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight, yeah
I get to be what she wants tonight, tonight
