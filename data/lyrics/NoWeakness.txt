[Chorus]
You wanna ride 'round with me?
Show me no weakness, this is not recess
I repeat, fuck what you feel
I sense that your bullshit is not needed here
Talk shit, I'll leave you here
You wanna ride 'round with me? (Me)
Show me no weakness (Weak), this is not recess
I repeat, fuck what you feel
I sense that your bullshit is not needed here
Talk shit, I'll leave you here

[Post-Chorus]
Is this your love? Oh babe, is this your love? 'Cause it isn't mine
There's no trust now, you'll see it's just a matter of time
And you had no home, so you moved into my mind
Bitch, you had no home, so you moved into my mind
Is this your love? Oh babe, is this your love? 'Cause it isn't mine
This is us now, you'll see it's just a matter of time

[Verse]
Ayy, smell fire, then they turn around to us (They look at both of us)
You admire that it could be me, it could be both of us (Could be both of us)
You're making fans right here 'cause you're in the light
Right when you're standing right here
Leave me would be your worst nightmare
You're with me now, and you're stickin' round here
But you know I put you first 'round here
Give you my love, and your boy get murked 'round here
Smell fire, then they turn around to us
(Wanna be by your side, wanna be by your side), ayy
You know I done some dumb moves but all I want is you, I
(Some dumb moves, but all I want is you)
Bitch, I think I love you, I
Ayy, I wanna be by your side, wanna be by your side
(Wanna be by your side, wanna be by your side)
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
You wanna ride 'round with me?
Show me no weakness, this is not recess
I repeat, fuck what you feel
I sense that your bullshit is not needed here
Talk shit, I'll leave you here
You wanna ride 'round with me? (Me)
Show me no weakness, this is not recess
I repeat, fuck what you feel
I sense that your bullshit is not needed here
Talk shit, I'll leave you here

[Post-Chorus]
Is this your love? Oh babe, is this your love? 'Cause it isn't mine
There's no trust now, you'll see it's just a matter of time
And you had no home, so you moved into my mind
Bitch, you had no home, so you moved into my mind
Is this your love? Oh babe, is this your love? 'Cause it isn't mine
This is us now, you'll see it's just a matter of time
