[Intro]
Yeah, baby

[Verse 1]
Out here, ain't nothin' but woods and water
Drop a beer from a stand, catch a fish with a bobber
Drink a beer out the can, Liquor out the bottle
How the good Lord intended it
Yes, he did

[Chorus]
I love my country
I love my country
Six strings and fiddles
Whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up Loud and proud, rolling into town
Hanging out the window like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country
I love my country up loud

[Verse 2]
Barbecue, steak fries
Styrofoam, plate date night
George Strait singing greats while We turning up sitting lake side
That pedal steel, she straight slidin' over here to me
She do that Alabama shake, Like you ain't ever seen

[Chorus]
I love my country
I love my country
Six strings and fiddles
Whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up Loud and proud, rolling into town
Hanging out the window like a bBluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I Love My Country
I Love My Country up loud
I Love My Country up loud
I'm talking way up loud

[Bridge]
I like pop and rock and rap
I like Skynyrd
And going out downtown when I'm with her
Like driving too fast Down a four-lane road
But damn sure nowhere close to the way that

[Chorus]
I love my country
I love my country
Six strings and fiddles
Whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up Loud and proud, rolling into town
Hanging out the window like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country
I love my country up loud (Yeah, baby)
I love my country up loud
Yeah, way up loud

[Outro]
That's a country ass lyric right there, boy
Haha
Yee!
