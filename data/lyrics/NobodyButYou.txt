[Verse 1]
Lord, I'm gonna get so high tonight
I'm gonna let the floodgates open wide
I'm in open water
This is what I need
And though I try to get you off my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And I get no sleep
I'm in too deep
I can't let you leave

[Chorus]
It wouldn't be right letting you go running away from love
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
So am I wrong giving my all making you stay tonight?
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
(Ain't nobody, ain't nobody)

[Verse 2]
(Hey)
Lord, I'm gonna bring you back tonight, girl
Oh, you're running circles round my mind
After your words have been my bible
How can I search for someone new?
When I really want you by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
And I get no sleep
I'm in too deep
To let you leave

[Chorus]
It wouldn't be right letting you go running away from love
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
(Ain't nobody, ain't nobody)
So am I wrong giving my all making you stay tonight?
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
(Ain't nobody, ain't nobody)

[Bridge]
Don't make me tear my heart out
I'm shaking 'til I fall down
Don't make me tear my heart out
Don't make me tear my heart out
I'm shaking 'til I fall down
Don't make me tear my heart out

[Chorus]
It wouldn't be right letting you go running away
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
So am I wrong giving my all making you stay tonight?
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
(Ain't nobody, ain't nobody)
It wouldn't be right letting you go running away from love
Ain't nobody but you I can hold onto
(Ain't nobody, ain't nobody)

[Outro]
Ain't nobody but you
