[Pre-Chorus: Nesi]
Before you ignored me (You ignored me)
Now I ignore you (Hmm, nah)
Before, you didn't want to (Didn't want to)
Now I don't want (Hmm, no)
Before you ignored me (-nored me)
Now I ignore you (Haha)
Before, you didn't want to (Ayy)
Now I don't want to
No, chill

[Chorus: Nesi & Bad Bunny]
I twerk alone (Hmm, ayy)
I twerk alone (Twerk alone, haha, hmm-hmm)
I twerk alone (Haha, hmm, ayy)
I twerk alone (Twerk alone)
Okay, okay, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: Bad Bunny]
That no pervert approach her (No)
The club turns up when she arrives (Woo!)
Men are her hobby
She is spoiled like Nairobi (Haha)
And you see her drinking from the bottle (Ayy)
The boys and the girls want with her
She is older than twenty, she showed me her ID (Uh-huh)
Ayy, she is skeptical of love (Woo!)
She's been single before it was a trend (Ayy)
She doesn't believe in love since "Amorfoda" (No)
The DJ plays songs and she knows them all
She climbs on the table and everyone else can get fucked (Woo)
When she twerks she doesn't stop (No!)
She smokes and gets horny
She'll call you if she needs you
But for now she is alone

[Chorus: Bad Bunny]
She twerks alone (Woo)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
She twerks alone
(Twerks alone, she twerks alone, alone, alone)
Ayy, she twerks alone
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
She twerks alone (She twerks alone)
She twerks alone

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
She has a problematic friend
And another one that almost never talks (No)
But the three of them are devils (Prr)
And today she is wearing a miniskirt
She keeps her phillies in the Louis Vuitton

[Bridge: Bad Bunny & Nesi]
And she calls me "papi" (Papi, yes, yes, yes)
She's really hot like Natti (Ah)
Drunk and crazy, she doesn't care (Woo)
Let's twerk, life is short, ayy (Hoo)
And she calls me "papi" (Papi, yes, yes, yes)
She's really hot like Natti (Ah)
After twelve o'clock she doesn't behave (Ayy)
Let's twerk, life is short (Woo)

[Pre-Chorus: Nesi & Bad Bunny]
Before you ignored me (You ignored me)
Now I ignore you (Hmm, nah, crazy)
Before, you didn't want to (But when did I say that?)
Now I don't want to (But, but, no)
Before, you ignored me (Nah)
Now I ignore you (I've never ignored you, babe)
Before you didn't want to (Oh, God)
Now I don't want to
No, chill

[Chorus: Nesi]
I twerk alone (Hmm, ayy)
I twerk alone (Twerk alone, haha, hmm-hmm)
I twerk alone (Haha, hmm, ayy)
I twerk alone (Twerk alone)
