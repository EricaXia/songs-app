[Intro]
Hey, whoa

[Verse 1]
Would you mind if I take my time, and admire you?
Candlelight, a little wine to set the mood
Baby, no, you won't have to do much
Ain't no pressure, we ain't gotta rush
Wanna know what's on your mind before we touch, touch

[Chorus]
So do you mind if I take my time? (Time)
Baby, we got all night (Night)
I wanna love you right (Oh-oh)
Do you mind if, if I take it slow?
We got all night to grow
And baby, please just let me know
Baby, let me know

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, it's all you gotta do, baby
It's all you got to do, baby
Oh whoa (Oh)
Can you hear me, babe?

[Verse 2]
I know plenty have, in the past, took advantage of
How beautiful you are, they don't know about real love
Oh my God, girl, just stand right there
That lingerie and them curls in your hair
I don't understand why he don't know what he had
Ooh girl, I've been watching you, waiting for tonight
Take it off, leave it on, ooh baby, I can't decide
So amazing

[Chorus]
So do you mind if I take my time? (Time)
Baby, we got all night (Night)
I wanna love you right (Oh-oh)
Do you mind if, if I take it slow?
We got all night to grow
And baby, please just let me know
Baby, let me know

[Post-Chorus]
My eyes on you (Yeah)
Wanna spend my life, my life with you
Don't worry 'cause it's saved, it's saved for you (Uh, for you)

[Outro]
So do you mind, if I take my time? (Time)
