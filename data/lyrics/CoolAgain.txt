[Verse 1: gnash]
It's been a minute since you called me back
If you're looking for me I'll be in this body bag
I mean, I told my mom I'm moving on and all of that
Oh and by the way, can I get my dodger hat back?
It isn't easy being left alone
But if all you need is me then why'd you let me go
I think it's best to let you know, if I'm being honest yeah

[Chorus: Shoffy]
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
I know I said that we'll be fine, but that was then, I guess I lied
It might take a little longer for us to be cool, cool again
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh (Cool, cool again)
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Shoffy]
Had my heart for over three years
Don't think you understand
Probably take double that to see clear
Keeping up ain't part of my plan

[Pre-Chorus: Shoffy]
Ooh, you don't know how this goes
If I'm being honest, yeah

[Chorus: Shoffy]
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
I know I said that we'll be fine, but that was then, I guess I lied
It might take a little longer for us to be cool, cool again
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh (Cool, cool again)
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh

[Bridge: Shoffy]
We had sketched out our future
You were mine and I was yours
You'll always have a place in my heart
Just need some time to heal

[Chorus: Shoffy]
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
I know I said that we'll be fine, but that was then, I guess I lied
It might take a little longer for us to be cool, cool again
Cool, cool again

[Outro: Shoffy]
Cool again, baby
Cool again
